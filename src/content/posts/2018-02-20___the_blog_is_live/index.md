Welcome to the Serving Niches Blog. After a few weeks of tinkering and 
working through bugs, this GatsbyJS powered blog is finally ready for 
prime time. All code for this site is open source and can be 
found [here](https://github.com/ServingNiches/gatsby-servingniches). 

### Issues encountered:  

- ##### Issue 1: The forked repo, that this site used as a starting point, needed to be ported to Gatsby V2. 

    __Fix:__ Go through the really good official documentation on porting from Gatsby V1 to V2 [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/migrating-from-v1-to-v2/). The Layout functionality had to be moved under the 
components and are treated just as another component instead a template that is applied to all pages. The layout functionality 
from Gatsby v1 can be recreated using the plugin "gatsby-plugin-layout".

    ```javascript
    // File: gatsby-config.js   
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-plugin-layout`,
      options: {
         component: require.resolve(`${__dirname}/src/components/layouts/index.jsx`),
       },
    },
    ```
  
  <br />
- ##### Issue 2: Images in markdown not being rendered 

    __Fix:__ Images in the markdown (.md) files were not being rendered. The problem was twofold.  
        
         1. The cover images could not be found.  
         2. The images in the blog post returned a 404.
    
    The fix involved adding two gatsby plugins 
    ```
    "gatsby-remark-copy-images": "^0.2.1",
    "gatsby-remark-images": "^3.0.3",
    ```

    ```javascript
    // File: gatsby-config.js
  {
          resolve: 'gatsby-transformer-remark',
          options: {
            plugins: [
              'gatsby-remark-copy-images',
            ],
          },
  },
  {
          resolve: 'gatsby-remark-images',
  },
    ```
    
    GraphQL should return a publicURL field that will contain the url for the image you're trying to display 
    in your component.
    
    ```json5
    ...
    cover {
           id,
           publicURL, 
           name
    },
    ...
    ```  

    ```javascript 
    export const query = graphql` 
      query {
      allMarkdownRemark (
      sort: { fields: [frontmatter___date], order: DESC })
      {
        edges {
          node {
            id,
            fields {
              slug
            },
            frontmatter {
              title
              subTitle
              cover {
                id,
                publicURL, 
                name
              },
              categories,
              date
            },
            excerpt
            headings {
              value
              depth
            }
            html,
            rawMarkdownBody,
            fileAbsolutePath,
          }
        }
      }
    }`;
    ```

### Features added:

- #####Feature 1: A blog section has been added. With the exception of styling, everything else closely follows the information found at the below links.
   
   Official GatsbyJS documentation on creating a blog  
   https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2017-07-19-creating-a-blog-with-gatsby/
   
   Egghead.io's FREE video series on building a blog with Gatsby  
    https://egghead.io/courses/build-a-blog-with-react-and-markdown-using-gatsby

<br />

- #####Feature 2: Individual blog posts are generated from markdown. 
    Technically, this isn't a separate feature but since the original idea was to 
    have individual posts styled differently, I'm going to leave this on here. 
    
   Programmatically create pages from data
